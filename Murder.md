# MURDER

## Official Rules

At round start, each player will be randomly assigned one of two classes:

    1. The (mostly) defensless bystanders;
    2. The murderer.

### Game End

The game ends when either:

    A. The murderer is dead;
    B. All of the bystanders are dead.

### Killing the Murderer

To kill the murderer, the bystanders must acquire a gun. One (1) of the bystanders will start the game with one.

### Acquiring a Gun

To acquire a gun, a single bystander must find a total of five (5) clues hidden across the map. Upon finding the fifth clue the bystander will receive a gun in his/her inventory or, if he/she already had one, will drop one on the ground that another bystander can pick up.

### The Gun

The gun is a "Golden Gun", it holds one (1) round in the it's clip at a time and its bullets kill anyone in one (1) hit, irregardless of location. The murderer **cannot** acquire a gun.

### Killing the Bystanders

To kill the bystanders, the murderer must strike a bystander with his/her knife. The knife has both a stab attack and can be thrown. Striking a bystander with either attack will instantly kill them.

### The Knife

Only the murderer can acquire the knife. The murderer will reaqcuire the knife if he/she walks on top if it after throwing it, or if a significant amount of time has passed since he/she has thrown the knife. The bystanders **cannot** acquire the knife.

### Clues

Clues can be identified by a glowing green outline. Once acquired, the clue will disappear and the number of clues one currently has will increment by one (1). This number is tracked in the lower left hand corner, under the player's name and in the middle of his/her color.

#### Bystanders

Upon picking up his/her fifth clue, a bystander will acquire a gun. If he/she already has a gun one will drop at his/her feet. The murderer  **cannot** pick up a gun.

#### Murderer

The murderer has two reasons to pickup clues:

    1. To deny those clues from a bystander;
    2. To assume the identity of a corpse.

### Abilities

#### Bystanders

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Bystanders have no abilities: none, nada, zero, zilch.

**GIT GUD!**

#### Murderer

The murderer has the following three (3) abilites:

    1. The murderer can sprint;
    2. The recent color-coded footprints of **ALL** players are visible to the murderer, including those of the murderer him/herself;
    3. The murderer can assume the identity of a corpse.

To steal a corpse's identity, the murderer consumes one of his/her clues. The muderer will then swap his/her appearance and name with that of the corpse.

## Controls

Murder has a very basic control scheme.

| Action | Usable by | Default Binding |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| Move forward | Both Classes | **W** |
| Backstep | Both Classes | **S** |
| Strafe Left | Both Classes | **A** |
| Strafe Right | Both Classes | **D** |
| Jump | Both Classes | **SPACE** |
| Sprint | Murderer Only | **SHIFT** |
| Action | Both Classes | **E** |
| Change Weapon | Both Classes | **MOUSE SCROLL** |
| Primary Attack | Both Classes | **MOUSE 1** |
| Secondary Attack | Murderer Only | **MOUSE 2** |

The action key is used to pickup clues and for the murderer to assume a corpse's identity.

The primary attack for a bystander fires the gun. The bystander has no secondary attack.

The primary attack for the murderer swings/stabs the knife. The secondary attack draws the knife back and, upon release, throws the knife.


## House Rules

When you're dead, **YOU ARE DEAD!**
- After death, no chatting - voice **OR** text - it adds to the suspense.
